# Exploratory Data Analysis Tool App



## Overview
This Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Tool is designed to assist users and data analysts in understanding their datasets through a comprehensive and interactive interface .This is designed using Streamlit, Python , Pandas and Autoviz.


## Features
This tool provides functionality for users to upload their datasets and perform basic data quality checks such as identifying column names ,check and fill missing values ,detecting outliers and finding duplicate rows.It also enables users to conduct:

1.Data Visualization : Generate various types of plots including histograms,scatter plots ,box plots ,correlation matrix and more.

2.Data Cleaning : Identify and handle missing values,outliers and duplicates.

3.Statistical Summaries : Display summary statistics for numerical and categorical variables.

4.correlation Analysis : Analyze relationships between different variables using correlation matrices and heatmaps.

5.Inferential Analysis : Conduct t-tests,F-tests,chi-square tests,shapiro-wilk tests for hypothesis testing.

6.EDA Report Generation : Automatically generate comprehensive EDA Reports.
